Leadership has the power to turn an army of sheep into a force that could defeat an army of lions. Now I see this as a principle which can be applied not only to war, but also to sports, business, politics, anywhere.</p>

"Quote of the day We Must Learn To Live Together As Brothers Or We Will Perish Together As Fools -Dr. Martin Luther King Jr .Learn to enjoy every minute of your life. Be happy now. Don't wait for something outside of yourself to make you happy in the future. Think how really precious is the time you have to spend, whether it's at work or with your family. Every minute should be enjoyed and savored."

"Getting To Know My Brothers And Our Mission
Yes, those are the strange male creatures that aren’t your father, but that roam your house anyway, often making their home in the bedroom next door to yours. Reports show that brothers in the “Teenagious Awkwardious” stage of development can be particularly gangly and just plain weird.  Brothers sometimes seem like they’re missing a brain cell or two—and I can say that because I am a brother. But despite the low expectations and mediocrity of our generation, the fact remains that young men are commissioned by God to rise up and “be a man,” leading the charge in pursuit of Jesus Christ. Paul exhorted Timothy to be sober minded, and to so demonstrate the life of God that he would be an example to all the other believers. Oh, how I love it when I see young men living in honor and passionate pursuit of Christ, and how I long to see ten thousand times more! I truly believe that there are great men of God being built in this generation!"

“I freed a thousand slaves I could have freed a thousand slave more if only they knew they were slaves”
Using a discredited, likely fake quote attributed to Harriet Tubman, West tweeted, “I freed a thousand slaves. I could have freed a thousand more if only they knew they were slaves,” implying that Tubman too believed many slaves were simply making the decision to stay in bondage.

If you’re mentally slaved you and have freedom and can do anything you want you won’t want to do anything you want because you will think that  you will get punished.A new era has opened upon the world!  The “dark age” of African oppression is drawing to its close; and the happy “millennium” of African Redemption is near at hand!-Marcus Garvey
Self respect Pt. 2
Respect is one of the most important qualities in your relationship with anyone, and there is no exception when it comes to your relationship with yourself. Self-respect encompasses a multitude of ideals, but it comes down to being the kind of person you are satisfied with showing the world and being someone that you and the people you care about are proud of. Self-respect is about having a sense of honor and dignity about yourself, your choices, and your life. It is about treating others well and knowing that by doing so, others will treat you well in return. Lastly, self-respect is knowing that not everyone will treat you well and choosing to respect everyone nonetheless, but still knowing that you deserve to be surrounded by great people. Having respect for yourself is vital in maintaining a positive self-image by allowing yourself to feel confident in who you are and content with the person you are

Solving problems with brothers
Having a group helps in brainstorming--everyone should feel free to submit their ideas, without any criticism. All ideas should be entertained by the group, and filtering should occur only after each member of the group has exhausted their supply of ideas, or the group feels that it is time to begin filtering out ideas.

 “I prefer to be true to myself even at the hazard of incurring the ridicule of others rather than to be false and incur my own abhorrence” Douglass has a high opinion of himself, and he knows that if he tells us that he always believed it was his destiny to be free, we might think he's a little arrogant or even crazy. But he tells us anyway, which shows us something important about him: he believes in the saying "To thine own self be true." And maybe he's right! -Frederick Douglass

How to respect your self
To have self-respect is to take yourself for who you are to wake up and forgive yourself for mistakes you have made. If you focus on the bad actions that you’ve done, you cave yourself into darkness and can’t see the good in life, which is what a lot of teenagers do. When you are down, try to remember the good that you’ve done and not the bad, because focusing on negative thoughts leads you to nothingness in the end. It’s hard to overcome some self-respect issues, but when you’re able to look in the mirror and smile and tell yourself you’re a beautiful person, it is an amazing feeling.respect

Quote of the day
How would they respond to a call from a severely depressed friend? A panel of experts evaluated their answers, and the results—along with several follow-up studies—reveal six insights about what differentiates wise people from the rest of us.
Solving community problems
It can be a lot of things. We know in our gut when there is a problem, whether or not we can easily put it into words. Maybe you feel uncomfortable in a given place, but you're not sure why. A problem might be just the feeling that something is wrong and should be corrected. You might feel some sense of distress, or of injustice.

Quote of the day
“To control a people you must first control what they think about themselves and how they regard their history and culture. And when your conqueror makes you ashamed of your culture and your history he needs no prison walls and no chains to hold you”.
 -John Henrik Clarke
Once in the demoralized state no one needs to hold you back because you already hold yourself back.
Powerful people cannot afford to educate the people that they oppress, because once you are truly educated, you will not ask for power. You will take it.Religion is the organization of spirituality into something that became the conquerors.

What does it mean to be a black man?
I was raised in a southern black home and was always taught to be proud of my blackness and accept who I am. They are fathers, brothers, friends, hard workers, that push through any difficult situation. Being a protector and provider knowing when to show strength and when to show the softer side. I would say the qualities and characteristics that I identify as a black male in America would be my intelligence, my passion for people I love and care for and my strength to preserver through hard.

iQuote of the day
“If we as a people realized the greatness from which we came, we would be less likely to disrespect ourselves” 
Respecting people is very important. Being rude and inconsiderate is a trait of selfish people who treat others like they are worthless. Remove these type of people from your life, and you will see how your life improves. Do not let anyone treat you like you are average. People who do not respect themselves tend to treat others bad from what I have seen. May these quotes inspire you to respect yourself and others to a higher standard.

It’s better to be prepared for an opportunity and not have one than to have an opportunity and not be prepared - Whitney M  Young 
Similarly to whitney young ,will smith is saying that you should be ready for anything.The commander must decide how he will fight the battle before it begins. He must then decide who he will use the military effort at his disposal to force the battle to swing the way he wishes it to go; he must make the enemy dance to his tune from the beginning and not vice versa.whitney M. young
t never made sense to me when people used that whole “life gives you lemons” metaphor as a lesson on how to deal with anything that life throws your way.
In my humble opinion, life often (dare I say almost always) hits you with unexpected events that are much more difficult to deal with than if you simply received a basket of lemons when you asked for limes ororanges.
Whether you’ve been hit with an unexpected bill, a death in the family, a power outage, or a stolen phone, here’s a simple guide to being ready for anything life throws your way, because life is a bit more complex than lemons and oranges.

<img src="../image/img-16.png">
Ignorance and prejudice are the handmaidens of propaganda. Our mission,therefore , is to confront ignorance with knowledge, bigotry with tolerance, and isolation with the outstretched hand of generosity. Racism can, will and must be defeated. Minorities can’t be racist because they don’t get power from it.With racism on this world we have to cope with it, we as black people are going to see it a lot. We have to learn how to deal with racism with also learning how to get rid of it and abolishing it. It’s important to know what racism is too, the term gets thrown so much that people have lost the real meaning of the term.

If you don’t respect yourself others won’t respect you.
If you aren’t organized people can’t help get you organized.You want to be respected, but you’re not sure how this whole thing works. The key here is to stop focusing on you, and start thinking about others. How can you help others.
How can you inspire change, growth, and innovation. When you think about the people you respect deeply, what do they do differently from the average person.

Building Brotherhood through respect 
I’m not talking about just “bros” you shoot the breeze with, but quality, salt-of-the-earth men you know have your back through thick and thin. I’ve felt a pull to build a brotherhood of men I can count on to meet up without hesitance and have real camaraderie with, not just guys that want to get wasted and chase women.And it’s painfully clear to me that most men are starving for a brotherhood that goes beyond beer slugging and fantasy football.brotherhood

“You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough.” 
― Mae West
Would you want to do, live a very long life, but a boring and ordinary one or would you want to live a very short but intense life? The answer to this question depends on what your idea of a good life is. You might be someone that values stability and routine or you might be someone that enjoys action and living always on the edge.
